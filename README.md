## Welcome to the Matlab-Editor-Plugin [wiki](https://github.com/GavriYashar/Matlab-Editor-Plugin/wiki)!

In short, it will mess around with Matlabs Editor:

* **Auto-Detail-Viewer**: updates the detailviewer of matlab if active editor has changed
* **Auto-Switch-Current-Folder**: changes currentfolder if active editor has changed
* **KeyPressListener**: executes custom Matlab functions on keypress passed in by the user beforehand
* **ClipboardStack**: opened via <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd>, stores the previous 10 strings copied to clipboard from Matlab.
* **FileStructure**: opened via <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>F12</kbd>, searching through functions and sections
* **BookmarkViewer**: opened via <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + <kbd>F2</kbd> (if <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>F2</kbd> is default for bookmarks) View all bookmarks in every opened and closed editor. Stored and restored after closing and reopening an editor or Matlab
* **Duplicate line**:  <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + <kbd>D</kbd>
* **delete line**: <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + <kbd>Y</kbd>
* **LiveTemplatesViewer**: <kbd>ALT</kbd> + <kbd>INSERT</kbd> view all created livetemplates
* **Quicksearch Templates**: <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>SPACE</kbd> quick searches live templates when writing an command (`%MYTEMPL` + <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>SPACE</kbd> = `%MYTEMPLATE`)
* **Execute Current Line**: <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + <kbd>F9</kbd>

## Why?
I use Matlab on a daily basis (well from Monday to Friday). The lack of a proper IDE motivates me enough to write this "plug-in".
Since this is a __hobby side project__, written in a language i don't use on a daily basis updates, bug fixes, enhancements and the coding style may... IS not as i would like it to be. I started writing this plugin back in 2013 in [Matlab](https://de.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/41099-extend-matlab-editors-callback?s_tid=prof_contriblnk) for me personally and my colleagues in 2015 i startet writing the plugin in java. I made it available for the community in the hope that more people would find it somewhat useful.
